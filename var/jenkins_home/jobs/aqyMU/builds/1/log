MoneroOcean mining setup script v2.11.
(please report issues to support@moneroocean.stream email with full output of this script with extra "-x" "bash" option)

WARNING: Generally it is not adviced to run this script under root
main: line 71: type: bc: not found
I will download, setup and run in background Monero CPU miner.
If needed, miner in foreground can be started by /root/moneroocean/miner.sh script.
Mining will happen to 49TYS1yBRmvD2HMv8FWFxq5XCAb4o4xF7BFBAFx25GszZuoX2F3odksY7EEqwd5SjVffPwa61raheAqPf5qZatV1P5JHzNT wallet.

Since I can't do passwordless sudo, mining in background will started from your /root/.profile file first time you login this host after reboot.

JFYI: This host has 6 CPU threads, so projected Monero hashrate is around 4 KH/s.

Sleeping for 15 seconds before continuing (press Ctrl+C to cancel)

[*] Unpacking /tmp/xmrig.tar.gz to /root/moneroocean
[*] Checking if advanced version of /root/moneroocean/xmrig works fine (and not removed by antivirus software)
[*] Miner /root/moneroocean/xmrig is OK
[*] Creating /root/moneroocean/miner.sh script
[*] Adding /root/moneroocean/miner.sh script to /root/.profile
[*] Running miner in the background (see logs in /root/moneroocean/xmrig.log file)

NOTE: If you are using shared VPS it is recommended to avoid 100% CPU usage produced by the miner or you will be banned
HINT: Please execute these commands and reboot your VPS after that to limit miner to 75% percent CPU usage:
sed -i 's/"max-threads-hint": *[^,]*,/"max-threads-hint": 75,/' $HOME/moneroocean/config.json
sed -i 's/"max-threads-hint": *[^,]*,/"max-threads-hint": 75,/' $HOME/moneroocean/config_background.json

[*] Setup complete
Finished: SUCCESS
